# Rustris
### A Tetris clone using SDL2 written in Rust

I originally wrote this tetris game in C and this is one the first Rust programs I have written, so it is probably inefficient and way too much code for tetris. I have sourced the original C code in a folder called original in this repo. That version used Ncurses and had multiple threads. It is a good example of what not to do, and breaks because of race conditions, a.k.a. my ineptitude with working on concurrent programs. 

Right now, the program is very basic looking but it works, more or less, as a tetris game. I might fix it up a bit but I don't have a real interest in doing so. 
I created a tetris game less to play it and more just to make some simple game in sdl2, so I have little interest in fixing it up.

The game I play constantly is my minesweeper program written in C with GTK3, located in my repo called [Mines](https://github.com/p0l1t1c1an/Mines). That game will most likely be continuously updated to improve upon the program, since I `love` minesweeper.

If you have the time, check out both this tetris clone and my minesweeper clone and alert me of any issues or potential improvements for my programs. I love to learn from my mistakes and know how I can improve my abilities. I especially would like to see how to make this tetris program less of a C porgram and more of a Rust program, as I feel like that is what I have been doing coming from, primarily, C and Cpp.
